## Installation

Use `$ make` or compile it anywhere else, `$ make win` does the trick on windows and cygwin/gitbash.
However if you use Visual Studio use the C++ implementation in __../src/cpp_implementation__.
It's a carbon copy of the *.c file but VS wants to use a *.cpp file.


## Features

This little piece of code compares 3 different implementations of a least mean square filter. 

+ local mean
+ direct predecessor
+ differential predecessor

Greyscale PPM files can be used for input at this iteration. Output will be generated as .txt files with predicted value generated by the filter and its error value as well as given actual value from the PPM file. Furthermore there is an output as an svg graph to compare the implementatiosn on a visual level. These graphical results are build  from __graphResults_template.html__ which  creates the actual output to __graphResults.html__. Open this file to see the results.
You can hide graphs by clicking on its name for better visibility. 

Use `$ ./lms -h` for help.

### Usage

coming soon ...


This code is ANSI compatible no POSIX, C99, C11 or GNU libs, because it had to be VS compatible . There are way easier methods like getline() or getopt(), I know ...
